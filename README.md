# Music Portfolio Site (deployed at https://scotcorm.github.io/music-portfolio/)
## Built with Bootstrap, and using JS and Wavesurfer for the music.

## About
This was a portfolio site for my nephew's music, with a few MP3s to serve as placeholders until he sends me his info.  
I learned more about using Event Listeners, and this was my first effort using wavesurfer, which was pretty great.
